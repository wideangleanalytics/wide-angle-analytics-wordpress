Easily add Wide Angle Analytics tracker script to your WordPress site. You can quickly configure your web analytics tracker script.

== Description ==
[Wide Angle Analytics](https://wideangle.co) is a privacy-friendly, GDPR-compliant web analytics service. You can deploy it cookieless or with cookies enabled.

We promote remote configuration, meaning you configure the tracker behaviour directly from our service interface. However, to give you full control, some settings must be applied before initial communication with our service takes place.

We provide you with the ability to configure the tracker script with few settings, making sure that you are tracking your traffic effectively. At the same time, we give you tools to prevent leaking any or unintended Personal Data.

Our plugin offers you as easy to use configuration wizard. The plugin will automatically inject the necessary HTML to both Header and Footer to make the script record website visits.

Once configured, you will get insight into your web traffic. You will get information about visitor:

1. count (unique and total page views),
2. location, down to province level,
3. browser and operating system,
4. pages viewed, and
5. where these visitors came from.

We are actively adding more data points and enrich the dashboard with additional information.

= Why isn't Wide Angle Analytics Free =

Some Web Analytics platforms are free, at least some amount of traffic. Google Analytics is a very prominent example. It is free up to 10 million events.

It is free because data about your traffic and your visitors is feeding Google's Advertising business. By getting the service for free, you are indirectly supporting your competition in having a more efficient advertising platform. You are also exposing your visitors to aggressive monitoring and tracking.

Wide Angle Analytics is not free. For a fee, you get service that handles your data with utmost respect. No sharing. No reselling. This is your data used solely for your analytics and business purposes.
